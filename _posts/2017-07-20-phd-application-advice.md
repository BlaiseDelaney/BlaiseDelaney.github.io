Coming soon. My experience on how to successfully gear up towards having a good interview and landing a Ph.D. in the UK.

While you wait, if you are contemplating applying to some ivy-adorned or a 'Pick-Your-Favourite-State' Institute of Technology and alike in the New Continent, I suggest you take a few minutes to read [Thomas' tips](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~wysejact/America.html).

*Good luck!*
