Coming September 2017, after my travels around Europe and before moving to Cambridge. I hope to review a series of key topics relevant to the Physics I aim to investigate. This will probably turn into a series where I review this branch of research with technical details and also in a broader way in multiple posts.

*Stay Tuned*.
