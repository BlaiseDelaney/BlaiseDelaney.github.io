So you are contemplating pursuing a PhD, *impressive*. Before diving into the nitty-gritty of applying, I think it's worth spending a little while expanding on why I decided to pursue graduate research. I was fortunate enough to attend the CERN Summer Programme a while back, and the prospect of joining an international experimenatal collaboration to tackle some of the open questions of fundamental science has since been my chief priority. I am unsure about whether there is a unique, well-defined set of reasons that should convince you to pursue a Ph.D. or not. However, if you feel like you harbour a genuine passion for a subject and you think you could (and _enjoy_) make an original contribution to the state of the art of your respective field of interest, my guess is that you're on the right track. 

There is a lot that can be said on the topic, but to make things a bit more concise, I decided to compile a list of steps. Perhaps you could use what follows as a checklist (or not).


<!--The following three points will be expanded upon in a further edit.

-  Why a PhD  (why pursue research - attitude, CERN Summer Programme, passion - and link to Blog post about what I expect of my Ph.D. right now, without knowing much but sure that this view will change)
- Why the UK and not US.
- How to identify the University and the programme.-->

*<u>Disclaimer</u>: I have compiled this post to share my experience of applying for a PhD position in High Energy Physics in the U.K. This post details my own personal views on the matter and, as such, they could be (hopefully only in part) erroneous. The steps below, however, allowed me to gain admission to several competitive programmes (with funding) despite me being a not particularly clever student. I hope that these tips might help future applicants as much as they proved instrumental in allowing me to pursue a graduate research position. For any remark on the following, please leave a comment.*


### Preliminaries

- The first question, assuming you found a specific topic/field of research that triggers a spark in your eyes, is _"where?"_. PhD programmes vary in a sizeable way from country to country. UK Ph.D.s normally last about 3.5 to 4 years, while the US programmes are longer, include a masters qualification, and seem to overall for about 5 to 6 years. If you are contemplating applying to some ivy-adorned or a 'Pick-Your-Favourite-State' Institute of Technology and alike in the New Continent, I suggest you take a few minutes to read [Thomas' tips](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~wysejact/America.html). In general, investigate to the best of your ability the research interests pursued by each group, and try to gauge how prominent their role is within the field. Here are some good resources to find out abou research in Physics: [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org), [CERN Document Server](https://cds.cern.ch). 
- Your references are arguably the most important factor before your interview. Seek out research intenrships with Respected academic active in your preferred field. This will give them time to get to know you and will enrich your application with the (hopefully) positive words of a researcher capable of assessing your potential in their own field of research.
- Funding: the real hurdle. Make sure you gauge the realistic chances of you getting any financial support throughout the programme. 
- Visit the Departments! Get a feel of the place! A good fit with your supervisor and you group is of paramount importance.


### Application Submission


- Something I like to do before submitting is getting in touch to the academics you'd like to work with. Introduce yourself and ask a couple of specific questions that are relevant to your specific interest; for example, I sought feedback regarding applications of Machine Learning to potential analyses.
- When compiling your letters explain what you hope to obtain from the programme, what assets can you bring to the Group and why you are a good fit given your background, your interests and your potential to be an enthusiastic student staff would enjoy working with. Again, show awareness of the state of the art and the role the Group played in that field and the avenues explored in cutting-edge research.
- Ask for feedback from anyone competent willing to read your statement.
- If appropriate tie it to your final project - something your should be very familiar with, more eon this later.


### The Interview


If you have good grades and reasonable exposure to the field, you should land an interview. Well done! That is already pretty impressive. My pro tip is the following: enjoy the interview. Here is what makes me say this:

- you’ve done your preparation, just rehearse it until you feel confident talking bout yourself, your passion, your research, the material you’ve studied in College and in your own time in preparation to this.
- You have the privilege of talking with experts: this should be a formative conversation, a chance to show what person you are, and to engage with the interviewers.
- You’ve gone this far, you clearly want this. In a way that’s all you can do - so just go in and try to make the most of it, regardless of the outcome.

> Enjoy this interview. You've done all the work, you're as ready as you can be. Engaging with a panel of researchers is truly a privilege and a great way to show your potential. Have fun and try to learn as much as you can, regardless of the outcome.


### Pro Tips to Actually Prepare the Interview


- Be enthusiastic: this should come natural, you should feel the spark in your eyes, don’t be afraid of showing it.
- Rehearse to get confidence and articulate what you’re going to say. This is probably the most awkward but rewarding bit (I used to talk to myself while cycling to lectures).
- Engage with who is interviewing you, always explain your train of thought (it will help the committee gauge how you think on your feet and also help you think clearly). The conversation is a dynamic process and in part what you say can change the direction pursued by the interviewer.
- **Know your project**. By this I mean you should know what you’ve done so far, why and how, and the end goal of your project and how it could in principle contribute to the state-of-the-art research and which open questions you could answer. It’s OK (in my experience, but I could be wrong) not to know the answer of the immediate trouble you’re having in that specific stage of your research e.g. how to optimise signal-background separation of your analysis; what is key is to explain the issue, and the ideas you might/should have to tackle that issue and how intend to develop the procedure to test them/implement your solution. (And same for past projects, in slightly less detail).
- Know your curriculum, especially the courses you've taken that are relevant to the project.
- Show that you can collaborate with people by really “rolling with the flow” in the interview and maybe explaining the dynamic you have with your current project supervisor.
- Anticipate obvious questions (why this programme, why this Uni etc.).
- Beware that interviewers are likely to ask technical questions related to their field of expertise. Gear up towards this - read papers!
- Be mentally prepared for the questions you don’t expect/know the answer to going in. This is the trickiest part of the process in my opinion. Again, engage and explain your thought and *beware that your perspective is very different from the interviewing panel* - more on this below.
- Try to have an interview in person to allow for non-verbal communication to occur - a pro tip I was given from a senior academic involved in the selection process. Again, more on this below.
- Prepare your own questions for the panel: I think decent topics to touch on are outreach and freedom to collaborate with people that may not strictly belong to your group. But then again, I could be sorely wrong. 
- Be aware that they might you ask questions regarding how much research you might have put into obtaining funding (the real hurdle in securing a position from all perspectives) - this shows also that you really want to pursue the programme - and in my opinion awkward such as “Is this your first choice?”, “How likely are you to accept an offer?”, “Where have you applied to?”, “Have you been accepted elsewhere”.
- Trust in the panel: they have done this many a time, they know much more than you do what potential looks like. This is really the basis of why you should engage with them as much as possible.


**Probably the most important thing to keep in mind**: a lot of components go into an assessment. While I have never been on the other side of the table, my takeaway message from multiple interviews is that your perspective is very different from the committee: a lot of non-verbal components go into it (including the enthusiasm and confidence factors mentioned above), your ability to think on your feet and engage dynamically with the conversation come across and are prime factors in the outcome of the interview. Many interviews I thought went horribly yielded not only a place but a full scholarship attached! To this day, I reckon my ability to judge an interview is a weak spot for me.



*If you have made the auspicious decision of starting to gauge what PhD life and applications might be like prior to your last year of undergrad (like I did) well done! Pro Tip: get as much exposure to different areas of research and through most diverse/international programmes as possible (list coming soon) - I tried Condensed Matter Physics, Theoretical Physics (QCD in a very basic group theory formalism), Cosmology (Dark Energy Survey), HEP-ex with focus on B-physics and sizeable exposure to data analysis through machine learning. Arguably research experience not only will make you stand out but also inform you on what life is like as a researcher in that given topic.*


*Best of luck, and feel free to get in touch for any further questions or feedback. I am always happy to help, subject to availability*. Thanks for reading.
