So you are contemplating pursuing a PhD, *impressive*. Before diving into the process of applying, I think it's worth spending a little while expanding on why one should decide to pursue graduate research. I was fortunate enough to attend the CERN Summer Programme a while back, and the prospect of joining an international experimental collaboration to tackle some of the open questions of fundamental science has since become my chief interest. I am unsure as to whether there is a unique, well-defined set of reasons that should convince you to pursue a PhD or not. However, if you feel like you harbour a genuine passion for a subject and you think you could make an original contribution to the state of the art of your respective field of interest (and *enjoy* doing so), my guess is that you're on the right track. 

There is a lot that can be said on the topic, but to make things a bit more concise, I decided to compile a *list* of steps I found quite helpful my time around. Perhaps you could use what follows as a checklist (or not).


*<u>Disclaimer</u>: I have compiled this post to share my experience of applying for a PhD position in High Energy Physics in the U.K. This post details my own personal views on the matter and, as such, they could be (hopefully only in part) erroneous. The steps below, however, allowed me to gain admission to several competitive programmes (with funding) despite not being a particularly clever student. I hope that these tips might help future applicants as much as they proved instrumental in allowing me to pursue a graduate research position. For any remark on the following, please leave a comment.*

<br>


## Preliminaries

The first question, assuming you identified a specific topic/field of research that triggers a spark in your eyes, is *"where?"*. PhD programmes vary in a sizeable way from country to country. UK PhDs normally last about 3.5 to 4 years, while the US programmes are longer, include a masters qualification, and seem to overall last for about 5 to 6 years. If you are contemplating applying to some ivy-adorned or a 'Pick-Your-Favourite-State' Institute of Technology and alike in the New Continent, I suggest you take a few minutes to read [Thomas' tips](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~wysejact/America.html). In general, investigate to the best of your ability the research interests pursued by each research group. Try to gauge how prominent each team is within the field. There are many ways to investigate this matter. Good starting points are research papers, research profiles and conference notes - see below for some useful resources for Physics (and other sciences, probably).<br> 
Your *references* are arguably the most important factor supporting your application. Seek out research internships with respected academic active in your preferred field. This will give them time to get to know you and will enrich your application with the (hopefully) positive words coming from a researcher capable of assessing your potential in their own field of research.<br>
*Funding*: the real hurdle. Make sure you gauge the realistic chances of you getting any financial support throughout the programme. Most Universities dedicate online pages and search tools to assess your financial status - make sure you perform a thorough investigation! Another good idea is to get in touch with staff in charge of admission and prospective supervisors. The former can provide you with a more realistic insight into the workings of the funding process, while the latter may have at their disposal special research funds partly allocated to take on grad students.<br>
*Visit the Departments.* Get a feel of the place! A good fit with your supervisor and your group is of paramount importance.

<br>

## Application Submission: Your Statement

Once you have a good idea of the strengths of the institutions you have identified as a good fit, you must start writing. Try to submit your applications well within the first deadline to maximise the chances of being considered by a broad spectrum of funding bodies. <br> 
Something I like to do ahead of submitting is getting in touch to the academics you'd like to work with. Introduce yourself and ask a couple of specific questions that are relevant to your specific interest; for example, I sought feedback regarding applications of machine learning to potential analyses at the Large Hadron Collider.<br>
When compiling your letters explain what you hope to obtain from the programme, what assets can you bring to the group and why you are a good fit given your background, your interests and your potential. Remember, you want to demonstrate that you are a candidate group members would enjoy working with. Again, show awareness of the state of the art, the role the group played in that field and of the avenues explored to tackle open questions.<br>
Ask for feedback from anyone competent willing to read your statement (I sought feedback from virtually all my family members, my course-mates and a couple of research students. I strongly believe that any form of input and feedback can be useful, if you think hard enough about it).<br>
If appropriate tie your statement to your final project (something you should be very familiar with, more on this later).

<br>

## The Interview


If you have good grades and reasonable exposure to the field, you should land an interview. _Well done!_ That is already pretty impressive. My pro tip for the facing the interview itself is *enjoy it!*. I know, tricky huh?! Consider the following:

- You’ve done your preparation - you have a substantial body of knowledge and a hearty dose of enthusiasm in you. Rehearse how you intend to deliver your reasons for joining that specific team and any other (what I call "fluffy") question of the sort until you feel confident talking about yourself, your passion, your research, the material you’ve studied in college and in your own time.
- You have the privilege of engaging in a _dialogue_ with experts: this should be a formative conversation and a chance to showcase your potential. The key words here are *engage* and *dialogue*.
- You’ve gone this far, you clearly want this. In a way that’s all you can do - so just go in and try to make the most of it, regardless of the outcome.

> Enjoy the interview. You've done all the work, you're as ready as you can be. Engaging with a panel of researchers is truly a privilege and a great way to show your potential. Have fun and try to learn as much as you can, regardless of the outcome.

<br>

### Tips to Actually Prepare for the Interview

Onto the juicy stuff. I have compiled the following list to maximise the ratio of tips to words (or the other way around?! - you know what I mean).

- Be enthusiastic: this should come natural, you should feel the spark in your eyes. You're all set on this front - just (here comes the cliché) be yourself.
- Rehearse to get confidence and articulate what you’re going to say. This is probably the most awkward but rewarding step (I used to talk to myself while cycling to lectures).
- Engage with who is interviewing you, always explain your train of thought - this will help the committee gauge how you think on your feet and also help you think clearly. The conversation is a dynamic process and in part what you say can change the direction pursued by the interviewer(s).
- *Know your project*. By this I mean you should know what you’ve done so far, why and how, and the end goal you are pursuing. You should be aware of  how your research could in principle make an original contribution to the state of the art and which open questions you could answer. It’s OK (in my experience, but I could be wrong) not to know the answer to the immediate issue you’re experiencing during that specific stage of your research e.g. how to optimise signal-background separation of your analysis; what is key is to deliver your explanation for said issue, and the ideas you might/should have to tackle it, and how intend to develop the procedure to test them/implement your solution. The same applies for past projects, in slightly less detail, probably.
- Know your curriculum, especially the courses you've taken that are relevant to the project.
- Show that you can collaborate with people by really “rolling with the flow” in the interview and maybe by explaining the dynamic you have with your current project supervisor.
- Anticipate obvious questions (why this programme, why this Uni etc. - again, the "fluffy" ones).
- Interviewers are likely to ask technical questions related to their field of expertise. Gear up towards this - read the papers they authored!
- Be mentally prepared for the questions you don’t expect/know the answer to going in. This is the trickiest part of the process in my opinion, and the most interesting set of questions: you really are tested for what you are, there are no shortcuts. Again, engage and explain your thought and *be aware of the fact that your perspective is very different from the interviewing panel* - more on this below.
- Try to attend the interview in person to allow for non-verbal communication to occur - a pro tip I was given from a senior academic involved in the selection process. Again, more on this below.
- Prepare your own questions for the panel: I think decent topics to touch upon are outreach, teaching experience you can gain and the potential freedom to collaborate with people that may not strictly belong to your group. But then again, I could be sorely wrong. 
- Be aware that members of the panel might you ask questions regarding how much research you have put into obtaining funding (the real hurdle in securing a position from all perspectives). Being able to answer readily this question shows that you really want to pursue the programme. Furthermore, a few (in my opinion) awkward questions can come your way, such as “Is this your first choice?”, “How likely are you to accept an offer?”, “Where else  have you applied to?”, “Have you been accepted elsewhere?”.
- *Trust in the panel*: they have done this many times, they are truly experts. Interviewers know what potential looks like. This is really the basis of why you should engage with them as much as possible.

<br>

### Probably the Most Important Thing to Keep in Mind
A lot of factors contribute to an assessment. While I have never been on the other side of the table, my takeaway message from multiple interviews is that your perspective is very different from the committee: a lot of non-verbal components go into it (including the enthusiasm and confidence factors mentioned above), your ability to think on your feet and to engage dynamically with the conversation are prime factors in determining the outcome of the interview. Many interviews I thought went horribly yielded not only a place but a full scholarship attached! To this day, I suspect that my ability to judge an interview might be close to very basic.

If you took the auspicious decision of starting to gauge what PhD life and applications might be like prior to your last year of undergrad, well done! My advice is to try to gain as much exposure to different areas of research and through most diverse/international programmes as possible; I completed research projects in Condensed Matter Physics, Theoretical Physics (QCD in a very basic group theory formalism), Cosmology (Dark Energy Survey) and Experimental Particle Physics, with a focus on B-physics and with sizeable exposure to data analysis through machine learning, and exotic spectroscopy. Arguably research experience not only will make you stand out but also inform you about what life looks like as a researcher on that given topic. If you are a Physics, Engineering or Computer Science student approaching your third year of undergraduate study, I strongly encourage you to apply to the [CERN Summer Programme](https://home.cern/students-educators/summer-student-programme). Being a "Summie" has been, hands down, the most significant event in my academic career - with a bit of luck, there is no reason why it shouldn't have a sizeable impact on yours.

Here are some good resources to find out about ongoing research in Physics (and probably other natural sciences): [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org), [CERN Document Server](https://cds.cern.ch). 

*I wish you the best of luck in your studies and applications*. Feel free to get in touch with any further questions or feedback. I am always happy to help (and learn!), subject to availability.

Thanks for reading. &#9640;
