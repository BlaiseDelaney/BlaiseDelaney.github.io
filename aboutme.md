I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge joining the High Energy Physics Group on the LHCb experiment at CERN. My research will focus on trying to understand the origin of _CP_ violation and the apparent dominance of matter over antimatter. I am also keen to expand on machine learning and software engineeringto improve upon Collaboration-wide software projects aimed at optimising grid computing, data taking and data processing. I completed my studies in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College, Dublin graduating with First Class Honours. I was a CERN summer student a while ago - I have since strived to carry out research in HEP.


Other thing I spend time thiniking about:

- A good espresso.
- Cycling.
- I used to fence a lot during the first half of my undergraduate degree at [Trinity](https://dufencing.wordpress.com), I hope to pick it up again soon.
- Outreach.
