I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge joining the High Energy Physics Group on the LHCb experiment at CERN. My research will focus on trying to understand the origin of *CP* violation and the apparent dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. I am also keen to expand on machine learning and software engineering to improve upon Collaboration-wide software projects in grid computing, data taking and data processing. I completed my studies in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College, Dublin graduating with First Class Honours. I was a CERN summer student a while ago - I have since strived to carry out research in HEP.

I share an unlikely link with the Nations mentioned above: I am half Irish, half Indian and I was raised in Italy. Way too many "I"-starting countries on my papers. 

Other things you might catch me spending time thinking about:

- A good espresso. I'd like to cycle around South America visiting coffee plantations.
- Cycling. 
- I used to fence a lot during the first half of my undergraduate degree at [Trinity](https://dufencing.wordpress.com), I hope to pick it up again soon.
- STEM outreach.
- One day I'll learn how to build electric guitars from an expert.
