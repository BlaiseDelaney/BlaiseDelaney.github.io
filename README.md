# blaisedelaney.science - Changing Basis. 

My personal blog to share my Ph.D. experience - toughts, code, theory and events. 

**Disclaimer**: This blog was conceived to share my own _personal experience_ and in now way is intended to represent any Institution I may be affiliated with. 

## Features

- CRUD capabilities for author
- CV or short summary of career, aside
- About: academia and maybe something more personal
- Twitter and GitHub Buttons as part of layour for `default` and `post` at bottom centre
- Blog Posts with assigned tags
- Tag search engine
- Techical section: code and Physics/Maths (probably within all blog posts intially with assigned tags).
- Teaching 
- Tutorials
- **Blogs Structure: class > (stream/series) > tags**
- Each blog post should have a snippet (i.e. an abstract available for preview)
- Each blog post shoudl have a "quote" summarizing the content at the end
- **Probably worth introducing two main pages: About>(Resarch, Teaching) and Blog>Streams/Series**
- Blog posts should be listed with date/stream/summary of content (limited character abstract) - distinction may be rendered better by using 3 colours mimicking the gradient of header


### To Do 

- Modify the config file to include buttons and logo
- Assign borders and shadow to wider logo
- Blog Posts page, initially sparse 
- Blog post tag system
- CV/Academic summary
- Better Twitter and GitHub buttons
- Introduce `About Me` button and remove link from `Index`
- Make logo and title clickable and link to Home page
- Clear structuring of posts in series
- Thumbnails for posts/series
- Blog navigation: being able to browse through different levels of classification
- Remove the `Back Home` button from `About`
- Keep GitHub, Twitter, Mail buttons fixed at bottom of every page: hard-code it into `yconfig`
- Clickable title and logo always 
- Assign Logo to link when copy/paste and on tabs
- Fancy page transitions: especially when navigating subsections of `About` or `Blog`
- Efficient back-navigation of posts
- CV not .pdf but a css shorter page

#### Blog Post Model
